        We’re currently sending out a new and improved Clubcard to all our customers. And yours should be with you very soon.</p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, you can still collect points with your existing card, a key fob or the Clubcard app. 
        Alternatively, you can keep your till receipts and take them with your new card to the customer service desk in store – they’ll add the points for you.</p>
        <p>If you haven’t received your new card by the 25 July, please come back and order your replacement card here as usual.</p>
