Akamai changes

I was working with the akamai team to get datacenter cookies created for us. this has been now done in 'staging akamai'
This is what has been done
1. Origin.aws1.mca-ppe.tesco.com has been pinned to certificate secure-Poe.tesco.com
2. Datacenter cookies created so we can provide query param and force traffic to a particular dc. Example. . Http://secure-ppe.tesco.com/clubcard/myaccount/home/home?DCMCAPPE=SDC will keep it to sdc and =AWS will take the traffic to our AWS origin
So, Can you please do a testing on this with SDC.  What you should see is when you login and check it should have dropped a cookie withe same name
Thanks Mrinal
